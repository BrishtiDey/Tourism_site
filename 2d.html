    <p>The Howrah Bridge is a famous suspension bridge that spans the Hooghly River in Kolkata, India. It is one of the busiest bridges in the world, carrying around 150,000 vehicles and over 4 million pedestrians every day.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The Howrah Bridge was built in 1943, replacing an earlier pontoon bridge that was unable to handle the increasing traffic. The bridge was designed by Rendel, Palmer and Tritton, a British consulting firm, and was constructed by the Indian firm Braithwaite, Burn & Jessop Construction Company. The construction of the bridge was a massive undertaking that involved over 26,000 workers and took eight years to complete.</p>
    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>The Howrah Bridge is a suspension bridge that is supported by two main cables, each made up of thousands of individual wires. The bridge has a total length of 705 meters and a width of 71 feet, and is painted in a distinctive blue and white color scheme. The bridge is also famous for its cantilevered design, which allows it to be used by ships and boats that need to navigate the Hooghly River.</p>
    <h2>Visiting the Howrah Bridge</h2>
    <p>The Howrah Bridge is open to traffic and pedestrians 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Visitors can walk or drive across the bridge to get a view of the Hooghly River and the surrounding cityscape. However, visitors should be aware that the bridge can be very crowded and noisy, and should take care when crossing.</p>
